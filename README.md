# peer-peer chat System

Project Description: 
Aim of this project is to develop a peer to peer Chat System such that users communicate safely.
A central database is developed to store user information associated with each sent (or) received message. 
Users have the capacity to check whether the messages sent have been received by the recipient (or) not alongside the timestamp. 
Users can also have an administrative role such as delete a user, block and unblock a user, emergency broadcast messages. 
Users can select their chat status (idle, busy,offline, available) based upon their interest. 
When the user is offline, messages should be sent as email to the user to their mail address. 
Authentication of the user depends on their username and password. And those credentials are stored in the database. 
When an account is created, an e-mail is sent to the owner of the account with login details and validity period for the account. 
Chat system has a friendly GUI providing all necessities to edit and read messages, configure account, add / remove users.
